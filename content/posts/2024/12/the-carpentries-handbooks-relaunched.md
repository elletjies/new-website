Today, 9 December 2024, we relaunched [The Carpentries Handbooks](https://docs.carpentries.org/)! The Handbooks are compiled for the following community roles: Community Session Hosts, Curriculum Advisors, Instructors, Instructor Trainers, Lesson Developers, Lesson Program Governors, and Maintainers. Each Handbook provides detailed information for our volunteer community members to fulfill the duties of each role, and includes steps to follow when onboarding onto and offboarding from the role, the responsibilities and duties for each role, as well as a list of resources available to members to fulfill those responsibilities. 

Furthermore, these Handbooks are also accompanied by curated general resources for our various programmatic areas such as Curriculum and Workshops. 

The relaunch of the Handbooks follows shortly after we [launched the new websites of The Carpentries and its three lesson programs](https://carpentries.org/blog/2024/11/the-carpentries-websites-relaunched/). Although all these platforms are interlinked, the Handbooks contain detailed information for active volunteers in onboarded roles or for community members already familiar with The Carpenries’ operations. The websites, on the other hand, are designed primarily for members fairly new to our community or members of the general public wanting to familiarise themselves with The Carpentries. 

## We Welcome Feedback
As with the relaunched websites, the Handbooks and their accompanying resources will also continue to be works in progress, and we invite any feedback you may already have as we continue to improve these resources. 

If you come across something that is not working as it should or you have any other feedback or suggestions for us to consider, please [submit an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/carpentries/docs.carpentries.org) directly from the resource or email us at [team@carpentries.org](mailto:team@carpentries.org).  

With the upcoming festive season holidays we may not have an opportunity to address or incorporate any feedback unless absolutely critical until late January 2025, but please send it to us anyway. We really appreciate it.
